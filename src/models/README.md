New form of training writes out {model}.{version}.{ext}

feats are the stored features that were used to train the model. 
E.g.
feats.1.0.npz  feats.1.0.pkl  feats.1.0.txt  knn.1.0.pkl  knn.1.0.pkl.stat  knn_cmd.1.0.log  rf.1.0.pkl  rf.1.0.pkl.stat  rf_cmd.1.0.log  svm.1.0.pkl  svm.1.0.pkl.stat  svm_cmd.1.0.log
